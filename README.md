# 📦 **Understanding Node.js Modules and Project Structure**

When you start a **Node.js** project, it automatically creates certain files and directories to manage your project’s dependencies, modules, and configurations. Here’s how everything works:

---

## 🛠️ **npm init - Project Setup**

When you run `npm init` (or `npm init -y` to skip the prompts), it creates the **`package.json`** file that serves as the **heart of your project**. This file contains the metadata about your project, including the list of dependencies, project scripts, version, etc.

### What does `npm init` do?

- **Generates `package.json`**: The `package.json` file will include important project information, such as:
  - **Name**: Your project’s name.
  - **Version**: The current version of your project.
  - **Scripts**: Custom commands you define (e.g., `npm run start`).
  - **Dependencies**: A list of packages your project needs.
  
This file **does not contain any code** or installed modules directly. It simply tracks them.

---

## 🗂️ **Node Modules Folder: `node_modules/`**

After running `npm init`, you can start adding **external dependencies** (like libraries and frameworks) that your project needs. When you install a package with `npm install`, it will be added to a folder called **`node_modules/`**.
